# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  The open community around the Atlas of Living Australia platform.
  As GBIF nodes, one of our goals is to highlight our publishers and their data.
  To achieve this, the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) developed a huge open
  source platform with several modules re-usable by other organizations.
  Since 2013, the community around this tool has organized technical workshops
  to present ALA modules to other institutions that wanted to implement it,
  to improve already existing national data portals and to learn from each other’s
  achievements.
