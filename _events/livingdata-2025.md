#### Description 

This session is part of the upcoming [Living Data 2025](https://www.livingdata2025.com/) conference.

We will contribute to the session titled [How Living Atlases and Nodes Support Regional Environment Policy and Decision Making](https://www.livingdata2025.com/sessions.html?session=6798640).

The Living Atlas community continues to grow and evolve as organizations across the globe adopt configurable and controlled infrastructures to serve specific regional needs at the scienceâ€“policy interface.

In this session, representatives from various Living Atlases and biodiversity infrastructures will present real-world use cases of how they support environmental decision-making within their jurisdictions. These contributions will showcase not only software functionality and data pipelines, but also the relationships between infrastructures and regional stakeholders. Examples include threatened species management, distribution modelling tools, and sensitive data handling.

The goal of this session is to highlight the shared and diverse ways in which biodiversity infrastructures influence science policy, and to understand the governance patterns that enable this impact. The outcomes will help the Living Atlases community assess and prioritize future collaborative development efforts.
