#### Description 

Since the beginning, our workshops have focused on the installation, the configuration, the customization of national data portals and basic types of data indexation. We want to improve our trainees skills on more complex indexations such as event, but also help them to develop specific features needed at a national level.

In order to do this, a workshop has been organized at the National Museum of Natural History (MNHN) in Paris. The focus of this workshop has been on the ALA spatial modules like the spatial portal and the explore region tool and also on analysis elements such as ALA4R.

GBIF Brazil covered the travel expenses of all the participants. This workshop has been founded by the [CESP Project (CESP2018-004)](/projects/cesp-2019.html).
