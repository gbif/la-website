#### Description 

The Kew Data Portal is an open-access platform developed by [Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew](http://kew.org), to share its extensive botanical and mycological collections with the world. The portal provides access to high-resolution images and metadata from Kew’s digitised herbarium specimens, with over four million records currently available. As digitisation continues, additional data from the Millennium Seed Bank and fungarium collections will be added. The initiative supports global research and conservation by making Kew’s vast taxonomic, specimen, and trait data publicly accessible.
