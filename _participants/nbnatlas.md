#### Description 

The NBN Atlas is managed and developed by the [National Biodiversity Network (NBN)](http://nbn.org.uk/), a UK charity whose priority is to grow national commitment to sharing wildlife data and information. The NBN Atlas can be found here: [https://nbnatlas.org/](https://nbnatlas.org/) and it is the base for four country hubs: 
- [NBN Atlas Isle of Man](../participants/nbnatlas-isle-man), 
- [NBN Atlas Northern Ireland](../participants/nbnatlas-northern-ireland)
- [NBN Atlas Scotland](../participants/nbnatlas-scotland) and 
- [NBN Atlas Wales](../participants/nbnatlas-wales).

The objectives of the NBN Atlas concern education, promotion of biodiversity and providing a trusted portal for UK biodiversity data.

The NBN Trust employs two full-time developers, a project manager, a data manager and two part-time support officers to manage, support and develop the NBN Atlas and country hubs.

The NBN Atlas uses the [UK Species Inventory](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/data/uk-species/species/index.html) as the species dictionary for the name indexer.
