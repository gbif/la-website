The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, has launched a **new version of its Data Portal**, offering enhanced tools for exploring and accessing biodiversity data.

The portal provides access to millions of botanical records, herbarium specimens, images, and datasets, with **improved usability, search features, and integration capabilities**. It also makes use of **open APIs and semantic web technologies** to support reuse and interoperability.

Get more info from the portal [here](/participants/kew) and more info about the launch in: [https://www.kew.org/read-and-watch/new-data-portal-live](https://www.kew.org/read-and-watch/new-data-portal-live).
