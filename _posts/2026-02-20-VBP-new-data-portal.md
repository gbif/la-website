The **Flemish Living Atlas (Vlaams Biodiversiteitsportaal)** has been officially launched, offering a central access point for biodiversity data from Flanders.

The portal provides access to millions of species occurrence records drawn from more than 300 datasets, with **enhanced search, filtering, visualisation and download tools** to support research, policy and nature management. Built on Living Atlas infrastructure, it supports **open data standards, APIs and interoperability**, facilitating reuse and international data exchange.

The Flemish Living Atlas is developed and maintained by the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO) and is closely connected to the Atlas of Living Australia, the Living Atlas community, and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), strengthening international collaboration and data sharing.

We congratulate the Flemish team on this important milestone.
